    <p>
      Yhdessä is an impact activation button. It is a 3.5m diameter circle of pavement, encircled by a circumference of fountain springs. This button is designed to require collaboration as 3-4 people minimum are needed to sum up the required 200kg
      of weight to press it down. People wanting to activate the button may need to reach out to passersby to join efforts.
      <br><br>The fountain is accessible as it has a soft slope that can be easily ascended on a wheelchair, with a baby carriage or with limited mobility. There are 3 benches that seat up to 2 persons each and all face towards the center. When
      sitting down on the benches, people will face each other and therefore see the water behind those across from them. This orientation is meant to invite interaction and, at the very least, a change in perception.
      <br><br>A favourable change in perception of those who participate in the experience with us could be triggered by the initial collaboration and the subsequent pause for the duration of the water sequence. Once pressed, a fountain activates
      around those on the button. The water shoots rise slowly at first to signal the start and the sequence lasts a couple of minutes, as to not inconvenience anyone. The water sequence around them forces participants to pause for the duration,
      creating a sense of repose in the fast rhythms of urban life.

          <p>
  The benches are equipped with microphones at either end. The placement of the microphones allows them to detect the voices of those sitting and also those standing in between the benches. When the microphones detect voices, the water sequences change and become more complex as the noise levels rise, rewarding interaction. People will need to talk, sing, or make noise to enjoy a nicer experience. There is a plate on the floor, next to the fountain, explaining how the button and the interactive microphones work, what to do to press the button, what to do to make the fountain change while the button is being pressed.

  Water is an important element of this installation for multiple reasons. It has audiovisual qualities, as well as material, that are organic and often found relaxing. Being a multisensorial experience, it can also be enjoyed by those with some sensory disabilities— for example, a blind person can listen and a deaf person can take in the visuals.
  The use of water in this installation in an urban context alludes to a metaphor of an oasis— a moment of respite and refreshment. The water for the fountain sourced from stored rainwater and this water is recirculated to reduce waste.

        <p>
  Increased social isolation can be a leading cause behind all sorts of intolerance and extremism, and eventually have the effect of dividing society. The lack of connection with the community around us leads to lack of empathy and a narrower world-view. Connecting with the community is the beginning of a healthy and strengthening exchange that can eventually lead to all sorts of initiatives, grassroots movements and an overall improvement in quality of life.
  <br><br>We are social beings and our need to interact with others and build relations is essential to our survival and happiness. Socialising can lower overall stress levels and lengthen our life expectancy. There’s no better way to be invited to connect than by enjoying something together in a disarming, safe space.
